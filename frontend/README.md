# Project Title

Investment Tracker

# Introduction

We designed a platform for Customer’s wealth management and investments in stocks as well as educate the customers regarding ESG  (Environmental Social and Governance) regarding stocks. Customers can use the app to get a view of all the current stocks and values. Apart from this, they can also build multiple portfolios with different agendas consisting of multiple  stocks. Depending on their emphasis, customers can create portfolios such as “community investing,” “ethical investing,” “green investing,” “impact investing,” “mission-related investing,” “responsible investing,” “socially responsible investing,” and “values-based investing,” among others by viewing those stocks along with ESG ratings on our watchlist. The app can be further extended to manage personal wealth.
Portfolio watcher is an application where users can view the up-to-date live prices of every stock. Users will also be able to see his/her transaction history.
